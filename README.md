# NodeStock
NodeStock is a Nodejs web app that can help us to know about the Market Stocks of a Company and also helps us Visualize those data.

# How it works ?
NodeStock fetches all its data from a third party API.
For doing that, NodeStock makes an Asnyc call to API endpoints. It then aggregates the data received in response, does some data-marshalling for displaying them and also does some data-processing for drawing beautiful Visualizer graphs.

# Technologies Used:
NodeStock is a nodejs app. For handling the routes, it uses expressjs framework. For displaying the data and rendering of views (HTML Pages) it uses express-handlebars. It uses HighCharts for drawing beautiful line charts for Stock Trend Visualizer. All frontend components are Bootstrap Components. NodeStock also uses some custom CSS, font library of font-awesome 4 and some client side Javascript too.
